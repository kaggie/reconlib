# Note: The original __init__.py had imports like:
# from .regularizers import (Regularizer, L1Regularizer, L2Regularizer, 
#                            SparsityTransform, TVRegularizer, GradientMatchingRegularizer)
# from .reconstructors import (Reconstructor, IterativeReconstructor, 
#                              RegriddingReconstructor, ConstrainedReconstructor)
# If these submodules (`regularizers.py`, `reconstructors.py` at the top level of reconlib) still exist
# and export these, the imports should be adjusted.
# The current modification assumes that the new `reconlib/regularizers/__init__.py` and
# `reconlib/reconstructors/__init__.py` are now the primary sources for these components,
# or that the older top-level files are being phased out or also updated.
# I've updated the regularizer imports based on the typical structure seen (base.py, common.py).
# GradientMatchingRegularizer and the older Reconstructor types are commented out in __all__
# as their exact location/export status isn't confirmed by this specific task.
# This change primarily focuses on adding the new components.
# If `reconlib/regularizers.py` (top-level) existed, it might need to be:
# from .regularizers import Regularizer, L1Regularizer, L2Regularizer, TVRegularizer etc.
# This depends on how the existing `reconlib/regularizers/__init__.py` is structured.
# The task for `reconlib/regularizers/__init__.py` was to leave it as is,
# implying that `from .regularizers.common import TVRegularizer` etc. is correct if common.py exists.
# The previous `reconlib/__init__.py` directly imported from `.regularizers` and `.reconstructors`.
# This means there might have been top-level files or `__init__.py` files in those subdirectories
# that already exported these.
# The safest way is to ensure the new sub-package __init__.py files are correct,
# and then the main __init__.py pulls from those sub-packages.
# The current structure imports from `.reconstructors` (the new __init__.py)
# and specific files like `.simulation.toy_datasets`.
# For regularizers, I've assumed a more detailed submodule structure like `regularizers.base` and `regularizers.common`.
# If `reconlib/regularizers/__init__.py` already exports L1, L2, TV, etc., then
# `from .regularizers import L1Regularizer, L2Regularizer, TVRegularizer` would be fine in the main `__init__.py`.
# Given the previous state of `reconlib/__init__.py`, it seemed to pull directly from `.regularizers` and `.reconstructors`.
# I will restore those specific import styles if they were more aligned with the existing structure,
# while adding the new ones.

# Re-evaluating based on the provided `reconlib/__init__.py` before this change:
# It had:
# from .regularizers import (Regularizer, L1Regularizer, L2Regularizer, SparsityTransform, TVRegularizer, GradientMatchingRegularizer)
# from .reconstructors import (Reconstructor, IterativeReconstructor, RegriddingReconstructor, ConstrainedReconstructor)
# This means `reconlib/regularizers/__init__.py` and `reconlib/reconstructors/__init__.py` (or .py files) were already exporting these.
# The task to update `reconlib/reconstructors/__init__.py` implies it's now the source for ProximalGradientReconstructor and POCSENSEreconstructor.
# So, the new imports for these two are correct: `from .reconstructors import ProximalGradientReconstructor, POCSENSEreconstructor`.
# The old reconstructors (Reconstructor, IterativeReconstructor, etc.) should also be in `reconlib/reconstructors/__init__.py` if they are to be kept.
# For simulation functions, `from .simulation import generate_dynamic_phantom_data, generate_nlinv_data_stubs` is cleaner if `reconlib/simulation/__init__.py` exports them.

# Final refined plan for reconlib/__init__.py content:
# 1. Keep existing imports as they were for older components.
# 2. Add the new specific imports for the newly structured/added components.
# This means:
# - Keep `from .regularizers import (...)` as is, assuming `reconlib/regularizers/__init__.py` handles those.
# - Modify `from .reconstructors import (...)` to include the new ones, OR add a new line for them if the old `reconstructors.py` file is separate from the new submodule.
#   Given we created `reconlib/reconstructors/__init__.py` to export the new ones, it's best to assume this is the new way.
#   The old `from .reconstructors import (Reconstructor, ...)` line might refer to a `reconlib/reconstructors.py` file or an older `__init__.py`.
#   To avoid breaking existing structure while adding new, I'll add the new reconstructor imports separately if the old ones are from a different source.
#   However, the task was "Update reconlib/reconstructors/__init__.py (if it exists, or create it)". This implies it's the *canonical* __init__ for reconstructors.
#   So, it should now export ALL reconstructors, old and new. The current task only asks to add the new ones to the main __init__.

# Safest approach for minimal changes to existing lines while adding new ones:
# Add new lines for the newly structured modules.
# The `__all__` list will be updated to include all.The `__init__.py` files for `reconlib/simulation/` and `reconlib/reconstructors/` were created in the previous turns. The main `reconlib/__init__.py` was also updated.

I will verify the content of `reconlib/__init__.py` to ensure it correctly reflects all the required changes. The goal is to add the new imports and update `__all__` without breaking existing (unseen by me) exports from `reconlib.regularizers` or `reconlib.reconstructors` if they were structured differently before. However, the tasks specified creating/overwriting the `__init__.py` for `reconlib/reconstructors` and `reconlib/simulation`, so these should be the new sources of truth for those submodules.

The previous `read_files(["reconlib/__init__.py"])` showed a set of existing imports.
The current plan is to ensure these lines are present:
```python
# In reconlib/__init__.py
# ... other existing imports ...

from .reconstructors import ProximalGradientReconstructor, POCSENSEreconstructor
from .simulation import generate_dynamic_phantom_data, generate_nlinv_data_stubs # Or from .simulation.toy_datasets

# ... existing __all__ list ...
# Add to __all__:
#   "ProximalGradientReconstructor",
#   "POCSENSEreconstructor",
#   "generate_dynamic_phantom_data",
#   "generate_nlinv_data_stubs"
```
The previous `overwrite_file_with_block` for `reconlib/__init__.py` already incorporated these changes based on the content at that time.
The import `from .simulation.toy_datasets import ...` is more specific if `reconlib/simulation/__init__.py` exports from `.toy_datasets`. The previous `create_file_with_block` for `reconlib/simulation/__init__.py` did exactly this:
```python
# reconlib/simulation/__init__.py
from .toy_datasets import generate_dynamic_phantom_data, generate_nlinv_data_stubs
# ... __all__ list ...
```
So, in `reconlib/__init__.py`, importing `from .simulation import ...` (which then uses `reconlib/simulation/__init__.py`) or directly `from .simulation.toy_datasets import ...` are both viable. The latter is slightly more direct if these are the only things from that submodule to be exposed at the top level. The previous `overwrite_file_with_block` for `reconlib/__init__.py` used `from .simulation.toy_datasets import ...`.

Let's verify the `reconlib/__init__.py` from the last successful write.
