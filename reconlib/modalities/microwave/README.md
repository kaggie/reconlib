# Microwave Imaging Enhancements

### Enhancement Idea 1 (Non-Linear Solvers)
Implement iterative non-linear solvers like BIM, DBIM, or CSI. This would require a forward solver for the full wave equation (e.g., using Finite Difference Time Domain - FDTD, or Method of Moments - MoM) and its corresponding adjoint.

### Enhancement Idea 2 (Specific Antenna Array Geometries)
Provide tools or operators tailored for common antenna array configurations (e.g., circular, planar) and data acquisition schemes (multi-static, multi-view).

### Enhancement Idea 3 (Frequency Hopping/Multi-Frequency MWI)
Support for MWI systems that use multiple frequencies to improve resolution and stability. The operator would need to handle data from different frequencies.

### Enhancement Idea 4 (Quantitative Imaging)
Focus on reconstructing quantitative dielectric property values (complex permittivity) rather than just qualitative contrast maps.

### Enhancement Idea 5 (Integration with EM Solvers)
Allow integration with external electromagnetic simulation tools (e.g., via Python APIs if available) to act as the forward/adjoint operator for advanced users.
