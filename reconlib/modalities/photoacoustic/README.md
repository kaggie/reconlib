# Photoacoustic Tomography Enhancements

### Enhancement Idea 1 (k-Wave Integration)
Provide an option to use the k-Wave toolbox (if installed by the user) for highly accurate forward and adjoint operators. This would require a wrapper around k-Wave's Python bindings or calling its command-line tools.

### Enhancement Idea 2 (Analytical Operators)
Implement analytical forward/adjoint operators for specific geometries like circular or linear arrays, which can be faster than full numerical solutions for those cases.

### Enhancement Idea 3 (Time Domain vs. Frequency Domain Data)
The current placeholder assumes time-domain sensor data. Consider if frequency-domain data processing is also relevant for some PAT reconstruction approaches.

### Enhancement Idea 4 (Multi-wavelength PAT)
For spectral photoacoustic imaging (sPAT), the operator might need to handle data from multiple illumination wavelengths to estimate chromophore concentrations. This could be a more advanced feature.
