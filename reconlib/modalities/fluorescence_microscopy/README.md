# Fluorescence Microscopy Enhancements

### Enhancement Idea 1 (Realistic PSF Generation)
Implement more sophisticated PSF models (e.g., Gibson-Lanni, Born & Wolf) that can account for optical parameters like numerical aperture (NA), wavelength, refractive index mismatch.

### Enhancement Idea 2 (Specific Super-Resolution Operators/Reconstructors)
*   `SparseLocalizationOperator`: For PALM/STORM, an operator that maps a sparse grid of emitter locations and intensities to a series of blurred image frames (simulating blinking). The adjoint would project back.
*   Reconstructors specifically for fitting PSFs or using L1-norm minimization for sparse localization.

### Enhancement Idea 3 (Blind Deconvolution)
Implement algorithms that can estimate both the true image and the PSF when the PSF is unknown or partially known.

### Enhancement Idea 4 (GPU-Accelerated Convolution)
Ensure convolution operations are efficiently implemented on GPU, as deconvolution can be computationally intensive. (PyTorch's convNd is already good).

### Enhancement Idea 5 (Handling Different Noise Models)
Extend reconstructors to handle Poisson noise (common in low-light microscopy) or mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise, beyond simple L2 data fidelity.
