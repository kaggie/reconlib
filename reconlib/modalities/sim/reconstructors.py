    Performs a basic SIM reconstruction in the Fourier domain.
    This is a simplified version and doesn't include advanced parameter estimation
    or robust component separation found in production SIM algorithms.

    Assumptions for this basic version:
    - Patterns are sinusoidal: I_pat = 0.5 * (1 + cos(k_pat * r + phase_pat)).
    - We need to know the k-vector (k_pat_x, k_pat_y) for each pattern.
      This must be derivable from sim_operator.patterns or new attributes in sim_operator.
    - The detection PSF (and thus OTF) is known from sim_operator.psf_detection.

    Steps (conceptual):
    1. FT each raw SIM image: Y_i(k) = OTF(k) * M_i(k)
       where M_i(k) is FT of (X_hr * P_i).
       FT(X_hr * P_i) = FT(X_hr) conv FT(P_i) = X_hr(k) conv (delta(k) + 0.5*delta(k-k_pat) + 0.5*delta(k+k_pat))
       So, Y_i(k) = OTF(k) * [X_hr(k) + 0.5*exp(j*phase_i)*X_hr(k-k_pat_i) + 0.5*exp(-j*phase_i)*X_hr(k+k_pat_i)]
       (This assumes pattern is 0.5*(1+cos(k.r+phi)). If I0*(1+m*cos), factors change)

    2. For each Y_i(k), try to isolate components X_hr(k), X_hr(k-k_pat_i), X_hr(k+k_pat_i).
       This is the tricky part, often done by solving a system of equations for each k-point,
       using multiple Y_i(k) from different phases.

    3. Shift the isolated components X_hr(k-k_pat_i) and X_hr(k+k_pat_i) back to their original positions.
    4. Combine/average these components in an extended k-space.
    5. Inverse FT the combined k-space.

    This placeholder will be even simpler:
    - Assume patterns are generated by sim_operator.utils.generate_sim_patterns
    - Try to estimate k_pat vectors from the patterns themselves (if not stored in operator).
    - A very simplified recombination.
