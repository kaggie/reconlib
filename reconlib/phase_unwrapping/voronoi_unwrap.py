    Placeholder for Voronoi-based region-growing phase unwrapping.

    This function is intended to be implemented based on the detailed user-provided
    pseudocode (originally titled `PUROR_Voronoi_Unwrapping`). The core idea is to
    use Voronoi cells generated from high-quality seed points to guide the phase
    unwrapping process, followed by path optimization and cell merging.

    Args:
        phase_data (torch.Tensor): Wrapped phase data (in radians). (D,H,W) or (H,W).
        mask (Optional[torch.Tensor], optional): Boolean tensor. True values are unwrapped.
        voxel_size (Tuple[float, ...], optional): Voxel dimensions (e.g., (vz,vy,vx) or (vy,vx)).
            Used for distance calculations and gradient computations. Defaults to isotropic (1.0,...).
        quality_threshold (float, optional): Minimum quality for a voxel to be considered a seed
            or to be processed during region growing. Defaults to 0.1.
        max_iterations (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations for loops,
            such as region growing or optimization steps. Defaults to 1000.
        tolerance (float, optional): Tolerance for convergence in iterative processes
            (e.g., path optimization). Defaults to 1e-6.
        neighbor_connectivity (int, optional): Defines neighborhood for region growing and
            other local operations (e.g., 1 for 6-conn in 3D, 2 for 18, etc.). Defaults to 1.
        min_seed_distance (float, optional): Minimum distance between selected Voronoi seeds.
            This helps ensure seeds are somewhat spread out. Defaults to 5.0.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Unwrapped phase image.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: This function is a placeholder and not yet implemented.
