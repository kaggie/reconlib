    Placeholder for PUROR (Phase Unwrapping using Recursive Orthogonal Referring) phase unwrapping.

    PUROR is an algorithm for 2D/3D phase unwrapping. The original algorithm,
    often associated with recursive orthogonal referring, was described by K. Su and J. L. Prince
    (IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, Aug 2000, Vol 19, No 8, pp 859-63).

    This function is currently a placeholder and does not implement the PUROR algorithm.
    User-provided pseudocode outlines a quality-guided region-growing strategy, which
    could serve as a basis for a native PyTorch implementation of a PUROR-like approach.

    Users wishing to use this specific algorithm will need to implement it based on the
    provided pseudocode or the original literature. Alternatively, consider using other
    phase unwrapping algorithms available in `reconlib.phase_unwrapping`
    (e.g., quality-guided (generic), least-squares, or Goldstein-based methods)
    if they suit the application.

    Args:
        phase_data (torch.Tensor): Wrapped phase data (in radians).
            Expected shape (D, H, W) or (H, W).
        mask (torch.Tensor, optional): Boolean tensor indicating the region to unwrap.
            True values are unwrapped. If None, the whole volume is considered.
            Shape should match `phase_data`.
        voxel_size (tuple[float, float, float] | np.ndarray, optional):
            Voxel dimensions (e.g., for calculating phase gradients if needed by the quality metric).
            Defaults to (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).
        quality_threshold (float, optional): Threshold for the quality map to guide
            the unwrapping process. Relevant for quality-guided region-growing.
            Defaults to 0.5.
        max_iterations (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations for region growing
            or other iterative parts of an implementation. Defaults to 1000.
        tolerance (float, optional): Tolerance for convergence if an iterative solver is used.
            Defaults to 1e-3.
        neighbor_connectivity (int, optional): Defines neighborhood for region growing
            (e.g., 1 for 6-connectivity in 3D, 2 for 18, 3 for 26). Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Unwrapped phase image.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: Always, as this function is a placeholder.
