    # 1. Finding an initial simplex (e.g., 4 non-coplanar points).
    # 2. Incrementally adding other points:
    #    - Find points outside the current hull.
    #    - For an outside point, identify visible faces.

    #    - Add new faces forming a cone from the point to the horizon edges of the visible region.
    # 3. Handling degeneracies (coplanar points, collinear points).
