# Potential Improvements for ReconLib

This document outlines potential areas for improvement and future development within the `reconlib` library.

## From the Voronoi Submodule Integration

The following points were originally listed in the `IMPROVEMENTS.md` file of the Voronoi submodule, which was integrated into `reconlib`.

*Future Improvements and Ideas*
*(Content from reconlib/voronoi/IMPROVEMENTS.md was: "# Future Improvements and Ideas" - which is minimal. This section can be expanded based on the actual content if it were more detailed, or specific items from the Voronoi library's known future work.)*

Given the minimal content, specific improvement points from the Voronoi submodule would be:
*   **Performance Optimization**: Many geometric computations (e.g., Delaunay, Voronoi cell property calculations) can be computationally intensive. Exploring GPU acceleration (e.g., using CUDA for PyTorch-based calculations) or more efficient algorithms (e.g., incremental Delaunay, optimized spatial data structures) would be beneficial.
*   **Robustness**: Enhancing robustness to degenerate cases in geometric algorithms (e.g., collinear points for convex hull, cospherical points for Delaunay).
*   **Advanced Cell Merging in Voronoi Phase Unwrapping**: The `MergeVoronoiCells_And_OptimizePaths` step in `unwrap_phase_voronoi_region_growing` is currently a placeholder. Implementing a robust graph-based or iterative optimization for this step would significantly improve unwrapping quality for complex phase maps.
*   **Expanded Geometric Utilities**: Adding more functions to `geometry_core.py`, such as polygon intersection, polyhedron boolean operations, etc.
*   **Support for Anisotropic Voxel Sizes**: Ensuring all distance calculations and geometric algorithms correctly and consistently handle anisotropic voxel sizes across the library.

## General Reconlib Improvements

This section is a placeholder for future ideas related to the broader `reconlib` library.

*   **Expanded Algorithm Zoo**: Incorporate more state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms for various MRI applications (e.g., compressed sensing with different sparsifying transforms, model-based reconstructions, advanced deep learning architectures).
*   **Standardized Data Interface**: Further develop `MRIData` or a similar structure to provide a consistent way to handle diverse MRI datasets (e.g., multi-contrast, diffusion, perfusion).
*   **Enhanced Deep Learning Module**:
    *   More pre-trained models for common tasks (denoising, unwrapping, super-resolution).
    *   Tools for easier training and validation of custom DL models within `reconlib`.
    *   Support for more complex unrolled networks.
*   **Documentation and Examples**:
    *   Comprehensive API documentation for all modules.
    *   More example notebooks demonstrating advanced use cases and pipelines.
    *   Tutorials on implementing custom algorithms using `reconlib` components.
*   **Testing Framework**: Expand the test suite for better coverage and reliability.
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: Broader and more optimized use of GPU capabilities across different modules.
*   **User-Friendliness**: Simplify APIs where possible and improve error messaging.
*   **Interoperability**: Better support for common MRI data formats (ISMRMRD, NIfTI, DICOM) and integration with other popular MRI processing tools.
*   **Benchmarking Suite**: Tools for benchmarking different reconstruction algorithms and operators on standard datasets.
*   **Advanced B0 Correction**: Implement more sophisticated B0 correction techniques, including dynamic B0 correction.
*   **Motion Correction**: Add modules for motion detection and correction in MRI.
