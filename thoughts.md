## Photoacoustic Tomography

*   **Enhancement Idea 1 (k-Wave Integration):** Provide an option to use the k-Wave toolbox (if installed by the user) for highly accurate forward and adjoint operators. This would require a wrapper around k-Wave's Python bindings or calling its command-line tools.
*   **Enhancement Idea 2 (Analytical Operators):** Implement analytical forward/adjoint operators for specific geometries like circular or linear arrays, which can be faster than full numerical solutions for those cases.
*   **Enhancement Idea 3 (Time Domain vs. Frequency Domain Data):** The current placeholder assumes time-domain sensor data. Consider if frequency-domain data processing is also relevant for some PAT reconstruction approaches.
*   **Enhancement Idea 4 (Multi-wavelength PAT):** For spectral photoacoustic imaging (sPAT), the operator might need to handle data from multiple illumination wavelengths to estimate chromophore concentrations. This could be a more advanced feature.

## Terahertz Imaging

*   **Enhancement Idea 1 (Specific THz Modes):** Implement operators for specific THz imaging modes, such as:
    *   `THzRadonTransformOperator` for CT based on transmission/absorption.
    *   `THzPulsedOperator` for time-domain reflection/transmission imaging, possibly including deconvolution.
    *   `THzNearFieldOperator` for near-field THz imaging.
*   **Enhancement Idea 2 (Frequency-Domain Processing):** Many THz systems (especially THz-TDS) acquire data that is naturally processed in the frequency domain. Operators could directly work with spectral data (amplitude and phase).
*   **Enhancement Idea 3 (Material Parameter Estimation):** Extend operators/reconstructors to estimate material parameters (e.g., complex refractive index, permittivity) from THz signals, not just an 'image'.
*   **Enhancement Idea 4 (Polarimetric THz Imaging):** Support for THz systems that measure polarization states, which can provide additional contrast mechanisms.

## Infrared Thermography

*   **Enhancement Idea 1 (Heat Equation Solvers):** Implement more realistic forward operators based on numerical solutions (Finite Difference, Finite Element) of the Bioheat or Pennes' bioheat equation for biological tissues, or standard heat equation for materials. This would require defining thermal properties (conductivity, capacity, density).
*   **Enhancement Idea 2 (Specific Active Thermography Modes):**
    *   `PulsedThermographyOperator`: Model the response to a Dirac-like heat pulse.
    *   `LockInThermographyOperator`: Model the response to a sinusoidal heat input, possibly operating in the frequency domain.
*   **Enhancement Idea 3 (Analytical Models):** For simple geometries (e.g., 1D heat flow, layered materials), implement analytical solutions (e.g., Green's functions) as operators.
*   **Enhancement Idea 4 (Defect Parameterization):** Instead of reconstructing a full subsurface map, the 'image' could be a set of parameters describing discrete defects (e.g., location, size, depth, thermal resistance). The operator would then map these parameters to surface temperature.
*   **Enhancement Idea 5 (Multi-frequency Lock-in):** Support for lock-in thermography data acquired at multiple modulation frequencies.
