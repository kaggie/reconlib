def deconvolve_cw_spectrum(spectrum, modulation_amplitude_mT: float, other_params: dict = None):
  """
  Deconvolves a CW-EPR spectrum to remove instrumental broadening.

  In CW-EPR, magnetic field modulation is often used for sensitivity enhancement,
  leading to a derivative spectrum that is also broadened by the modulation
  amplitude. Deconvolution aims to recover the underlying absorption spectrum
  and improve spectral resolution. This is often a crucial preprocessing
  step for spectral-spatial CW-EPR imaging or for accurate lineshape analysis.

  Args:
    spectrum: The recorded CW-EPR spectrum (often a derivative).
    modulation_amplitude_mT: The peak-to-peak modulation amplitude in mT.
    other_params: Dictionary of other parameters relevant to deconvolution,
                  e.g., linewidth, lineshape model (Gaussian/Lorentzian).

  Returns:
    A placeholder string for the deconvolved CW spectrum.
    This will be replaced with an actual spectrum (e.g., NumPy array).

def apply_kspace_corrections(raw_kspace_data, correction_parameters: dict):
  """
  Applies common corrections to raw k-space data from Pulse EPR experiments.

  Before Fourier Transformation, k-space data often requires corrections for:
  - Dead-time effects: Missing data points at the beginning of FID/echo.
  - Echo centering: Ensuring the peak of the echo is at the correct k-space origin.
  - Phase errors: Correcting phase shifts due to hardware or sequence timing.
  - Baseline distortions: Removing offsets or drifts in the signal.
  - T2*/T2 decay compensation: Optionally weighting data to counteract signal decay.

  Args:
    raw_kspace_data: The acquired k-space data (e.g., NumPy array).
    correction_parameters: A dictionary containing parameters for each
                           correction to be applied, e.g.,
                           {'dead_time_points': 5, 'apply_phase_correction': True}.

    A placeholder string for the corrected k-space data.

def radial_recon_2d(data, angles):
  """
  Performs 2D radial reconstruction (e.g., filtered backprojection).

  This is directly applicable to Pulse EPR when a radial k-space acquisition
  scheme (projections acquired at different angles) is used. Each 'data' entry
  would be a 1D k-space line (e.g., an echo profile acquired under a readout
  gradient, with the gradient rotated for each new angle).
  It's also applicable to CW-EPR if projection data is acquired, for example,
  by rotating a sample in a fixed gradient or by rotating the magnetic field
  gradients around the sample.

  Args:
    data: A list or NumPy array of 1D projections (k-space lines for Pulse EPR).
    angles: A list or NumPy array of projection angles in radians.

  Returns:
    A placeholder string for the 2D reconstructed image.
    This will be replaced with an actual image (e.g., NumPy array)
    once numerical libraries are integrated.
  """
  # In a real implementation, this would involve steps like:
  # 1. Applying a Ram-Lak filter (or similar) to each projection.
  # 2. Backprojecting the filtered projections onto an image grid.
  # For Pulse EPR, data might need gridding before FBP if not perfectly on radial lines.

def radial_recon_3d(data, angles_phi, angles_theta):
  """
  Performs 3D radial reconstruction.

  Similar to 2D, this is directly applicable to Pulse EPR with 3D radial
  (or "kooshball") k-space sampling. Each 'data' entry is a 1D k-space line.
  It's also applicable to CW-EPR with 3D field gradients, where spectra under
  different gradient orientations (defined by phi and theta) serve as projections.

  Args:
    data: A list or NumPy array of 1D projections (k-space lines for Pulse EPR).
    angles_phi: A list or NumPy array of projection angles (phi) in radians.
    angles_theta: A list or NumPy array of projection angles (theta) in radians.
