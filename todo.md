    Diffusion Models:
        Use Case: Medical image synthesis, data augmentation, or reconstruction (e.g., generating synthetic MRI scans to expand limited datasets, or super-resolving low-resolution medical images).
        Benefit: Addresses data scarcity, enhances model robustness, and improves generalization.

    Continual Learning / Lifelong Learning Architectures:
        Use Case: Adapting models to new clinical data over time (e.g., new disease variants, new imaging protocols from different hospitals) without experiencing "catastrophic forgetting" of previously learned knowledge.
        Benefit: Crucial for sustained performance in dynamic healthcare environments.

    Advanced Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) Techniques:
        Use Case: Learning powerful representations from large amounts of unlabeled medical data, which is often more readily available than expertly annotated data.
        Benefit: Reduces reliance on expensive manual annotations and improves pre-training effectiveness. Examples include contrastive learning (e.g., MoCo, SimCLR adapted for 3D medical images) or Masked Autoencoders (MAE).

    Federated Learning Architectures:
        Use Case: Collaborative model training across multiple healthcare institutions while preserving patient data privacy, as raw data never leaves its source.
        Benefit: Addresses privacy concerns and regulatory challenges, enabling broader data access for model training.

    Causal Inference Models with Deep Learning:
        Use Case: Moving beyond correlation to understand causal relationships in healthcare data, which is vital for clinical decision support (e.g., predicting treatment effects or identifying true risk factors).
        Benefit: Provides more interpretable and actionable insights, aligning with Explainable AI (XAI) goals.

Other Improvements to the Library

    Expanded Explainable AI (XAI) for 3D Medical Data:
        While XAI is mentioned, extending examples to specific 3D techniques (e.g., 3D Grad-CAM, integrated gradients for volumetric data, or concept activation vectors for medical concepts) would be highly valuable given the prevalence of 3D medical imaging.

    Benchmarking and Reproducibility Tools:
        Integrating tools for experiment tracking (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases) and providing clear scripts for reproducing results would enhance research usability. Standardized evaluation metrics relevant to medical tasks (Dice, Jaccard, AUC) should also be emphasized.

    Broader Integration with Medical Imaging Standards:
        While MONAI is included, demonstrating integration with other essential medical imaging libraries or data standards (e.g., pydicom for DICOM handling, ITK/SimpleITK for advanced image processing pipelines) could broaden the library's applicability.

    Examples for Uncertainty Quantification:
        Including methods to quantify model uncertainty (e.g., using Bayesian Neural Networks or Monte Carlo Dropout) is critical in clinical settings, allowing clinicians to understand the reliability of model predictions.

    Deployment-Focused Examples:
        Providing simple examples for exporting trained models to optimized formats (e.g., ONNX) and integrating them into basic serving frameworks (e.g., FastAPI) would help bridge the gap between research and practical clinical deployment.
